# Mission // #001

## SITREP//INFILTRATION_OPERATION?CARDHOLDER

# Goals

- Secure intel on the payload.
- Secure intel on the coordinates of the payload rendezvous point.
- Secure intel on a means of travel.
- Formulate an exit strategy from the space station.

# Stakes

- Time is critical. We know that the payload will pass through the sector within 24 hours, so don't dally.
- Keep a low profile. Allowing the station to alert nearby facilities could complicate things.

# Reserves

- We have a trace on Chief Intellience Officer Sen'Hua somewhere in the station. He should have intel on flight patterns in this sector.
- We have acquired a key card with access to a restricted area of the facility.

# Roles

- OMEN : Infiltrate the facility. Utilize your Infoskin to pass as David Hawthorn, a low-level Tech Administrator and see what you can scoop up. Bring some ordnance in case you need to get somewhere off-limits.
- STAR//CHILD : Make your way into the facility with OMEN and split off to find a suitable access terminal. Do what you do best.
- THORN : Your egress point will be near the hangars. You will be on standby in case any valuable intel is passed from OMEN or STAR//CHILD. You're a local miner off shift in the cantina. Stay out of trouble until you're needed.
