# MSMC Transport Carrier // 2.21.5014u

Your frames have been shipped as cargo to Warehouse E-1 within shielded crates. In addition to intel on the payload, the access codes needed to access the warehouse will need to be acquired.

# Roles

- **OMEN** : INFILTRATION/DEMOLITION
- **STAR**//CHILD : HACKING
- **THORN** : LOCAL INTELLIGENCE/ASSAULT
- **PROPHET** : NOT PRESENT

## BRIEFING

- **OMEN** : Infiltrate the facility. Utilize your Infoskin to pass as David Hawthorn, a low-level Tech Administrator and see what you can scoop up. Bring some ordnance in case you need to get somewhere off-limits.
- **STAR//CHILD** : Make your way into the facility with OMEN and split off to find a suitable access terminal. Do what you do best.
- **THORN** : Your egress point will be near the hangars. You will be on standby until any valuable intel is passed from OMEN or STAR//CHILD. You're a local miner off shift in the cantina. Stay out of trouble until you're needed. The hangars are the nearest entry point to the warehouse zones.
- **PROPHET** : Rusty is on standy with transportation to move you to a vantage point intersecting the payload's flight path.
