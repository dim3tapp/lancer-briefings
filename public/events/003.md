# HERSCHEL 7 MINING OUTPOST // 2.21.5012u

We have been unable to locate the vessel with conventional scans. It appears that the cargo is being transported via a sci-trans freighter with sensor dampeners. PROPHET, you will not be able to rely on long range scanners to make your shot. The engines of the vessel must be cripple so it crashes onto the nearby mining outpost. Unfortunately these outposts are used to not only refuel, but to store valuable deposits during long hauls, so they are surprisingly well defended. We will need to get in and get out, but do what you must to secure the casket.
