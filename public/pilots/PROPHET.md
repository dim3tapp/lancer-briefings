Greva has been a part of this Union outfit since the beginning. An enigmatic leader who is prone to fits of fanaticism and proselytization about his machine god religion. Despite this, he remains a pillar in the company -- dependable on the field and unflappable, except for his irrational fear of NHPs and AI in general, again, due to his religious views.

His massive mech, MACHINE GOD is Greva's way of becoming closer to his diety, and when he is on the battlefield, it almost seems like he is blessed by some higher power. The towering HA Barbossa is a walking colossus with a planetary siege cannon mounted on its shoulder. Once the PROPHET finishes his sermon, absolution is all that is left...
