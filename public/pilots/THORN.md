Ferrous Foss... in a past life he was a criminal. Repeat violent crimes, rubbing shoulders with the dregs of society, and becoming inextricably intertwined in dangerous gang wars. When the Third Committee abolished penal colonies, however, Ferrous was suddenly abdicated of all crime. If that were the end -- or beginning, perhaps -- of the story, that would make sense, but after 'obtaining' a mechanized hard-suit for a return to more profitable 'ventures', he found himself face to face with the grim reaper of their current merry little band, PROPHET. The Lancer saw something in this sorry excuse for a man, but Foss proved to be outmatched and outgunned. That would be the first time he died.

Cloning usually has its quirks, but either luck or maybe PROPHET's unintelligible ramblings about the god of machines triggered a particularly potent side-effect when Ferrous Foss was pulled from the vat. Irrecoverable memory long term memory loss, and inexplicably, retention of short term memory -- something that should be impossible, given this Ferrous Foss is a completely different being than the one decomposing planetside.

Foss was recruited as a Lancer, and although he did not sink into his deviant ways, he resisted PROPHET's attempts to groom him into a believer in his quirky neo-existential religion. He took the callsign THORN, fixated on the only long term memory still left with him -- a fleeting memory of his childhood, and a young boy's naiive attempt to pick a rose by grasping at its jagged stem.
