Jesk is one of the rare members of the team who spent the first half of his life planetside -- embedding the quirks of a terran colonist into his psyche -- while spending over a century (though not for him) watching time pass through the starview port of a freighter. The dilation of time changes a man, especially seeing the effects on your homeworld. Jesk always felt like he belonged among the stars, though after travelling through them, he also began to fear them... to respect the majesty and magnitude of the void. He found himself drifting instead into the endless void of the omninet, finding a strange connection between countless stars and endless nodes of data spread across the known galaxy.

His abilities brought him back to the stars, in a HORUS pattern group as a Lancer. To him, what HORUS created was like a manifestation of the void of space and the omninet, and he himself a child of the stars. His pattern group LAST VISION wasn't so much named as a threat, but as a reminder to himself of the epiphany he experienced while connected to the omninet that everything was connected. That epiphany was the last vision his old self experienced before his awakening as STAR//CHILD.
